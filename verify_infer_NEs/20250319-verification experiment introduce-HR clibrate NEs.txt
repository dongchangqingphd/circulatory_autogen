preset conditions:
model: NESAN_modules.cellml
scripts: 'run_autogeneration.sh' + 'run_param_id.sh'
ground true source:
use generated model and change 'ISO_init' and 'ACh_init' value, then in simulation screen to generate 10 seconds simulation results, export simulation results CSV file, use FFT algorithm to calculated the maximum voltage and minimum voltage and frequency of heart rate, those 3 value as ground true value put into 'SANHR_obs_data.json' file, the modified 'ISO_init' and 'ACh_init' value as what we need to compared with predict value.
calibrate value:
'ISO_init' and 'ACh_init', the range from [0,1000] and [0,100]

process:
1) ensure the max_V, min_V, frequency in '*_obs_data.json' file, not change other default values, such as std is default 1, weight is default 1;
2) ensure the 'ISO_init' and 'ACh_init' values in '*_parameters.csv' file is a random values, such as [0.1,0.1];
3) change 'user_inputs.yaml' file, and change the new model name, such as 'SANHR5', but do not change other default values, so the iteration is default 6, cost_convergence is default 0.001;
4) run 'run_param_id.sh' to calibrate 'ISO_init' and 'ACh_init' value, until print best fit parameters;
5) compare the best fit ISO and ACh value with the preset 'ISO_init' and 'ACh_init' value and record;
6) found some experimental prediction results do not match the preset value, and used those predicted values to generate new simulation results, but in new simulation results, although max_V and min_V are very close to the ground true (GT) value, the frequency usually is a little far away with the ground true value, maybe frequency value is very sensitive, and usually is a small value that ranges from 1 to 3, therefore every iteration calculate cost function, the fitting of this GT value is not very accurate due to the threshold accuracy. It may also be related to the error calculation weight of this GT.

analysis:
1) I think logically, the automatic calibration scripts should calculate the accurate results, just like if I use ISO_init=10, ACh_init=0 simulation results to calibrate the model, best-fit parameters should be [10,0], but now some experimental results do not match, it must include some issues;
2) I also did another experiment that preset ISO_init=50 and ACh_init=0 and got the best-fit parameters as [10.0458075,0], and the result is extraordinary; the GT frequency is 2.799 but used best-fit parameters to do the simulation only got a frequency of 2.1.
